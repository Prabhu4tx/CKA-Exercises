<h1>CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) Exercises </h1>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

I was so pleased to find this repo: https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises when I was preparing to become CKAD. However, I could not find the same structure and design for the CKA Certification. I understand that the CKA Certification is more demanding, as a result, I thought why not follow the same concept and create my own Repo to help others study. 

Below, you'll find a set of exercises that will help you prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam. You can use these exercises to help you get more ready for the real exam. 

For the exam, you are allowed to have one extra browser tab open, which you can use to refer to the Kubernetes official documentation. I would not advise that you rely heavily on those documentation, because you only have a limitted amount of time to finish the exam. 

My tactic while taking the exam was to at least visit each question once. Then I would attempt right away to do the questions that I knew. If I didn't get it right on the first go, I would attempt once again. If I didn't get it then, I would move on to the next question and mark the unfinished one in the notepad (provided in the exam browser page.)
